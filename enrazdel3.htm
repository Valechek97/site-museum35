<h2 id="rum">GABRIEL RYUMIN</h2>
</center>

<P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rumin always assisted ruined countrymen, fire victims, poor families, not forgetting to read about the benefits of a long instruction tireless work and well-behaved lifestyle.
Sometimes giving someone in need of a certain amount of money, he kept saying: <br/>
- I give you this very sum provided, however, that you used the money to common sense. <br/>
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;
On the other hand, Gabriel V. sincerely sorry for the poor and often just as gifts to their money. Tradition has brought to us a curious case. He lived in a poor tradesman Ryazan, creepy drunk.

<img src = "images/rumin.jpg" width = "240" height = "300" title = "Gabriel V. Rumin" alt = "Gabriel V. Rumin" align = "right" hspace = "10" vspace = "10"/>

He was a contemporary of Gavrila Vasilyevich. Sometime in early youth in poverty Rumin took in his debt three copper pennies. And Harin, mindful of them, got into the habit to go to the fabulously wealthy
debtor and tipsy, screaming under the windows of his house: <br/>
- Hey, Gavryushka! Repay! You owe me three money! <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Him on a tray money - so not a penny, and the ruble. Harin pick up paper money and left. However, prop them after a while he appeared again and demanded to return a penny. once Upon A Time,
angry at such effrontery, ryuminskie lackeys beat him, but all in vain. Harin periodically appeared at the house of Gavrila Vasilyevich, other youth, and forced him to transfer money. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an Orthodox Christian, Rumin forgave sinful drunkard. Its the same voluntary and involuntary sins smoothed charity in relation to the churches. Gabriel V. constantly helped
  Trinity Church in the village Tuma, whose owner he was. Old wooden church to the beginning of the XIX quite dilapidated and Rumin in 1823, the year began construction of a new building. rector of Trinity
Church was then Fr Ivan Rostislavov father Professor St. Petersburg Theological Academy, Dmitry Rostislavova priest who described the charity Rumin: "Priests,
in the parish who were ryuminskie peasants could safely go to the master them. Almost no example that at explaining the church needs, he refused to manual if asked, but for the most part
  always gave a considerable sum. My father in the construction of a stone church in various other cases, was to him more than once ... had to take the most polite manner. Sometimes even that
he was involved with one little father and listening to their needs, and asked to sit, drink tea, and talked with him for an hour, two, leaving even their guests. Twice the father had the opportunity to see him
  treasury. One of the cases he described. After hearing the story about the needs Tumskoe church Rumin called his housekeeper and asked my priest: "Will the father priest in my pantry?".
  It was set up on his one corner of his house, with no windows. First there was, it seems, red wooden door, then followed with several iron locks. When both doors were open,
father, who followed the housekeeper and Rumin in pantry, saw a large iron chest, chained on all sides. First Rumin tried padlocks, then told the housekeeper to unlock
chest, and when the lid is opened by means of a mechanism, he quickly looked at the inside of the chest, where the father noticed a heap of bills and bags of coins. The old man said the housekeeper:
"Take away in the corner a thousand rubles." Taking it in his hands, he had locked the chest, tried every lock after it locked housekeeper; did the same with the door locks.
When they came into a room, he told the housekeeper to put a bunch of keys in the drawer, where it took them before, and the key to it has put in his pocket.
Gave money to my father and asked certainly count them, he said: "I am, sir, in the chest keep little money, but the pantry himself always go for them - it is safer». <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interesting notes left DI Rostislavov the attitude of Gavrila Rumin to Tumskoe peasants. "This former blinschik and porters, who became a state councilor,
rich, and the godfather of the Emperor does not seem to forget about his former poverty and was a very good landlord about their peasants. Dues imposed on them is very small,
  RR 20-30 with taxes, supplied the land to the peasants more than sufficient, and most importantly - his name served to protect them against bureaucratic chicanery.
  Ryuminskogo peasant feared poprizhat and the police captain, and the assessor, and the lawyer, and even all the time of separation, the ingredients for the production of any investigation ... <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumin peasants lived well, the poor among them were a rarity. In Tum and about her ryuminskie peasants were the most prosperous ». <br/>

</center>
<P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In autumn 2007, sublimely solemn, light and joy were held in Ryazan during the celebration of the 200th anniversary of Skorbjashchenskoj church. This is the only temple of God in Ryazan,
  which was not closed any hard times of persecution of the church, nor in war and postwar years. The rest were subjected to desecration and destruction, and many no trace. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the same time celebrated the 255th anniversary of Peter I Malshina, by means of which was built this temple. How can you not surprised? Truly - it is not an accidental coincidence of anniversaries,
and fishing Almighty? <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now appropriate to recall the well-known philanthropist Ryazan again. Because 200 years ago opened the first hospice in our city (1809)
which was built and kept the same at his expense. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Beneficence PA Malshina served for the benefit of the Ryazan hramostroitelstva, education, cultural development, social ...
 
<img src="images/malshin.jpg" width = "240" height = "330" title = "Peter A. Malshin" alt = "Peter A. Malshin" align = "right" hspace = "10" vspace="10"/>

An important part of the activities of this extraordinary personality was also the city's public and the public service. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let's start with the history of the race Malshinyh, which goes back to ancient times. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the years 1595-1597 Daniel Malshin had shelves (counter) in the meat row Lower tenements, and later traded in his barn in the city (ie the territory of modern Ryazan Kremlin).
His son, Kuzma Malshin possessing entrepreneurial talent, not only continued his father's work, but also made significant progress in trade. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By the early seventeenth century Malshiny mentioned in the discharge and payment books Pereyaslavl-Ryazan peasants Borisoglebskaya settlement belonging to the bishop.
  (Now here Seminary Street). <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich, taking care of the replenishment of the treasury, in 1649 mandated that "the best in their trades and crafts" peasants in black townsmen settlement. These
  number of hit and Kuzma Malshin transferred from Borisoglebskaya settlement, do not pay taxes. So Malshiny steel tradespeople people New Chernoposadskoy settlement
(now the streets are Catholic and Postal). <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We grandson Kuzma Kuchma, Epiphanes Solzhenitsyn, had four sons: Nazar, Ivan, Peter and Matthew. But only the descendants of the eldest of them went in for trade.
So, Nazar Epifanovich be called the founder of the dynasty of merchants, for his sons - Alex and Lukyan - in the middle of the eighteenth century were considered already Ryazan merchants. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The family Nazarovich Alexei and his wife Mary Tikhonovna Malshinyh in 1752 had a son, Peter, who became one of the most famous philanthropists among Ryazan merchants. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Make a fortune and secure social position Peter A. Malshin could, occupy a favorable while the mercy of wine.
In 1783-1787 years he, together with Gavrila Vasilyevich Rumin, filmed wine farming in the city of Ryazan, Mikhailov and the Saviour with the counties. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was the largest in Ryazan salotopenny plant, which annually produces up to 40 pounds of fat. When the plant is working picker.
Fat and hemp went to the capital. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Things went well and in 1790 its capital exceeded 50 thousand rubles. Peter Malshin became a merchant 1st guild and received a distinguished citizen. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the years 1791- 1794 Peter A. was mayor. As stated in the certificate issued to him Ryazan policeman magistrate service
he performed his "good faith and without burdening society, repairing the full benefits grad benefits». <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the early nineteenth century, Peter A. Malshin was the largest landlord in Ryazan.
He owned 10 houses, most of which were profitable, ie surrendered vnaёm for residential, commercial and warehouse space. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Malshinu brought considerable income and estates with serfs in the village of Ryazan province Ablova
 
 
<img src = "images/bogodel.jpg" width = "300" height = "180" title = "Malshinskaya almshouse" alt = "almshouse" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace ="10"/>

and Saransk County Penza province. By the way, the right to buy the peasants he bought together with the rank of court counselor, granted him by the decree of Paul-I in 1800. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He received a knighthood and joined the civil service, was eliminated from the official merchants. But continued to engage in business.
Peter A. in 1800-1810-ies took contracts for the supply of salt in Ryazan, Tula and Tambov Province. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Peter A. Malshin earned the respect of citizens for their charity, which is actively engaged with the 90-ies of the XVIII century. The first charity
  shares Malshin carried out in conjunction with GV Rumin. In 1793, the construction of a building for the General People's College, they donated five thousand rubles.
  Together, they have financed the construction of the first tier and the cathedral bell tower. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the years 1801-1804, Peter Malshin participated in the rescue of the cathedral of the Assumption Cathedral from destruction. Contrary to the decision of the Synod of its demolition, they GV
Rumin initiated the restoration of the shrine, took over the organization of all preparatory and restoration work and paid a significant portion of the cost
(twenty thousand fifty). Of these twenty - malshinskih had fourteen thousand. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The second main temple Ryazan - winter Nativity Cathedral (former Assumption) - was also blessed with Peter Alexeyevich. In the last year of his life he gave
  there are two icons in silver-gilt vestments: the temple icon of the Nativity and the icon of St. Nicholas. Helped Peter A. and Sarov. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But mostly the brainchild of philanthropist was open in 1809 hospice. In 1806, PA Malshin made fifty thousand rubles in the Order of Public Welfare
the establishment of a nursing home. Fifteen thousand of them were used for the construction of a stone building, and thirty-five thousand rubles - leaving them
"Forever untouchable capital", the interest from which is intended for the maintenance of Ryazan men's almshouse for the elderly 12. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This event had great resonance in society. A special decree of June 5, 1806, addressed to Peter Alekseevich Malshinu Alexander-I expressed my
"Special grace" to act Malshina. The same decree founding almshouses "graciously granted" was the Order of Anna 2 nd degree. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Construction of facilities was completed in December 1808, and in 1809 a hospice was opened. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Originally it contained 12 retired soldiers and 12 poor burghers and peasants government. Until 1816 contained a merciful institution
  entirely on funds bequeathed Malshinym. When the number of its inhabitants has increased to 34 people, some of the costs assumed the Order of public charity. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1832, Emperor Nicholas-I, being in Ryazan, visited the poorhouse, found her "in good form" and deemed it necessary to continue to refer to the institution
  "Disability Malshina home", as most prizrevaemyh it were retired soldiers. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1880, there were held more than 100 men and women. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Malshinskoy until 1919 was called and the street on which the building is located almshouses (now Liberty Street in the area from the street. Astrakhan to the street. Yakhontova). <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you believe the local historians of the last century, Peter A. their offspring dedicated to the memory of his wife. It is more than possible, since the death of his first wife, Irina Maksimovny,
and the opening of almshouses occurred in one year. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
IM Malshina, nee Rubtsov (1762-1809), came from an old Ryazan merchants. The couple had no children, but have been married for about 30 years. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Malshina second wife, Barbara Afanasevna and "underage heirs" lived in St. Petersburg. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Peter A. left behind another monument in Ryazan. In 1807, at the newly formed Skorbjashchenskom cemetery
it means stone church was built, which houses three altars: the main - in honor of the Mother of God "All the Afflicted",
