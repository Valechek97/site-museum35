<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How not to talk about the place, which is located next to our museum? Besides, Kanishchevo village also has its own history, which you can meet in our museum.
A summary of the village can be found here. To do this, we used the material on this site <a href="http://www.history-ryazan.ru" target="_blank"> http://www.history-ryazan.ru </a>, which refers to a variety of sources.</P>

<h2 id="pros">ORIGIN OF NAME OF THE VILLAGE</h2>
</center>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the "full geographical description of our fatherland" PP Semenov said that the ancient name of the village - Skorpischevo.
Skornischevo or Skornevtsevo. According to the locals Skornischevo name comes from the fact that originally lived here furriers.
According to another version, the village was once famous for the fact that there were woven cloth - filigree. And when a local resident asked "Where is he?", He replied that "Since Skanischeva." And inquiring heard - "with Kanishcheva." Hence the Kanishchevo.
However, in another embodiment of this version of the name comes from the filigree for the poor - Kanishchevo.
On the other, the same folk version of the origin of the name refers to the time of the Mongol invasion. Ostensibly Tatars already hosted in these places, sent
in meadows local kids look in scattered horses. Speaking at the same "look for horses." (Another version of the legendary origin of the name of the village associated with the Tatars and horses,
Look with. Korostovo Ryazan region).
And according to one version, the original name of the village was Skornischevo after the famous battle Ryazan with the Muscovites in 1371.
Allegedly in order to build a defense, Ryazan tore trees with roots (hence Skornischevo) and cut down their roots to meet the enemy.
However, it still does not work, and the battle that we lost.</P>

<h2 id="pohod">THE MILITARY CAMPING OF DMITRY DONSKOY</h2>
</center>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the military campaign of the Moscow Prince Dmitry Ivanovich against Prince Oleg of Ryazan in 1371 Chronicle reports the following:
"Toe winter byst carnage on Skornischeve with ryazantsi." Some researchers believe that Skornischevo - this is Kanishchevo.
By location and consonance of names they coincide. But perhaps the fact that the text of the chronicle crept error, because he chronicler
on the site of the battle was not, and recording was carried out with the words of the governor, who returned from a hike.
Now sources allow you to restore the original history of the village. Prince Oleg in the first half of the XIV century.
moved the capital of his principality of Old Ryazan Pereyaslavl (now Ryazan). It took place at the new ground for the content of princely herd of horses.
Oleg then and liked the area where now stands the village. It was close to the city, just five miles. And its upland meadows, surrounded by small groves, were good pasture. And soon there appeared paddocks with shelters for horses, stables and a log cabin for grooms. And the place where they watered the horses became known Konishchev, Konischevo, Kanishchevo.
Konischevo village located 8 miles from Ryazan 'at Lake without a name. "Near him, according to the chronicles, the battle took place between Moscow Prince Dmitry Ivanovich and Ryazan Prince Oleg in 1371. First it was the palace village, and there were, according to tradition, the palace stables.
The name comes from the horse pasture, which is here. Another suggestion: since the population was calling swamp that surrounded on three sides. A small village located on a three mountains - Semtsino, Manchuga and Kanishchevo. Such an arrangement avoids flooding of houses during the flood.
In this village there was in 1371, that is for 9 years before the Battle of Kulikovo, great battle between the troops and Prince Dmitry Donskoy. Oleg of Ryazan. Here is how this battle, of course, somewhat biased, Moscow chronicler "of Ryazan, fierce and proud people, ascended before the mind,
that in his madness started talking to each other: "Do not possess weapons and armor, and take only the belts and ropes, what would knit timid and weak Muscovites."
The latter, on the other hand, went with humility and sighing, calling on God for help. Vainly waving Ryazanians his rope and belt loop (lassos);
they fell as the sheaves were slain like pigs. "Another chronicler says: "And there was abuse and fierce slashing evil, and God help the soldiers led. Vol. Dmitry. Ryazan Well pobegosha and Prince Oleg leak in a small squad. "</P>

<h2 id="selo">PREOBRAGENSKIY CHURCH VILLAGE KANISCHEVA</h2>
</center>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Holy Transfiguration Church is located in the northwest of the city of Ryazan in a densely populated neighborhood Kanishchevo. Seen from afar its dome, a few kilometers spreads chimes,
calling for worship. The temple has three altars: Central - Transfiguration, left - in honor of St. Nicholas and the right - in honor of the Mother of God called "Kazan". <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  From an architectural point of view, as the researchers note, "we are talking about first-class facilities for the Ryazan land even unique." Temple is very simple in its proportions, but at the same
glorious time. Cube temple ends flat low rotunda dome. In the interior of the northern and southern walls are placed four column Doric loggia. Originally church and bell tower
stood separately and only later were joined by the refectory, which was built a chapel. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Daily services are held in accordance with the Charter of the Russian Orthodox Church, committed required, for children and adults organized a Sunday school.
Beautiful and majestic temple. What does it tell us? Consider its symbolism: the cube of the temple symbolizes the earth, the dome over it - Mount Tabor, which was transfigured Lord shining cross - is the glory of Christ.
By the transformation calls us temple, to the transformation of souls, hearts and our land. Calls all the faithful to enter the Kingdom of Heaven - the Kingdom of Christ is not of this world! <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
According to legend, in seconds. Kanishchevo originally existed church of St. Nicholas. Russian people venerated the saint of God, Nicholas the Wonderworker of Myra as a gracious intercessor and
Obidimo defender, formidable enemies. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Not once ravaged village Kanishchevo enemies, as it was close to the capital of the Ryazan principality Pereyaslavl-Ryazan (modern Ryazan). Particularly difficult time fell to Russian
  People in the early XVII century - the so-called "Time of Troubles." The country hosted the troops interventionists - Poles, Swedes and the gang of robbers. In 1618, Cossacks led by Hetman
  Sagaydachnogo, unable to take the Kremlin Pereyaslavl-Ryazan, looted and burned the fort. It can be assumed that the village Kanishchevo and other surrounding villages suffered the same fate. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Perhaps, then, and burned the church of St. Nicholas. The villagers decided to build a church dedicated to the Transfiguration. In any case, the tax books for 1676 in this village is listed
  already Transfiguration Church, with her at the time, there were 163 court. This is the first historically reliable evidence about the church in the village Kanishcheva. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Other documents it is known that in 1792 mayorsha Natalia Khrushchev at his own expense instead of a small church erected a new wooden church and asked in 1795 to consecrate him.
However, this temple stood for long - he burned August 24, 1814. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thunderstorm 12th year as close swept from Ryazan land that her breath felt all the inhabitants of the province. Countless refugees fleeing from the French, went to Ryazan and beyond.
Ryazan militia took place near the village on the road to defend the borders of Ryazan Ryazan province. In memory of those killed in the war were built at this time in Russian churches. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Residents with. Kanishcheva, which at that time was already 200 yards, a new church decided to build a stone, a spacious. In addition, a new church was to be a monument to the Russian victory in the
Patriotic War of 1812. When funds were collected, the parishioners entrusted to conduct business on the construction of the church local landowners Stanislavski Ogarev. In 1824 a new church
was built. Some researchers believe that the church in the village. Kanishcheva built the famous Russian architect VP Stasov, who in the 20s and 30s of the XIX century worked in Ryazan province,
in particular, is known for its buildings in the village Perevles. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   With a  rhitekturnoy point of view, as the researchers note, "we are talking about first-class facilities for the Ryazan land even unique." The temple is very simple in its proportions,
but at the same time majestic. Cube temple ends flat low rotunda dome. In the interior of the northern and southern walls are placed four column Doric loggia.
Originally church and bell tower stood separately and only later were joined by the refectory, which were built chapels: the right - in honor of Our Lady of Kazan,
left - in honor of St. Nicholas. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   But then came the second Troubles in Russia. After the Bolsheviks came to power, Russia became immersed in the darkness of unbelief. In 1922, under the pretext of helping the starving new
  authorities seized from the temple valuable ecclesiastical items, including silver-gilded removed the robe with the Mother of God.
   1938. Remember the villagers: "We arrived from Ryazan and the church was closed. Inside the gold stripped. Bells threw, all perekolotili, then taken away to be melted pieces ... ".
   This was the so-called "godless five-year period," when the government set a target to completely destroy everything that reminded him of the Orthodox faith. The temple was turned into a warehouse. First, there was stored grain, then building materials, spare parts for machinery.
   But the temple proved durable, time and human malice could not destroy what created people with love and kindness. We must remember with gratitude those who donated funds and built a temple in the XIX century -
they built it for us living today. We should also be grateful to those who care and their participation has made the return of the temple in 1989, the Orthodox Church. <br/>
